# Ball Physics Simulation

## Description
The **Ball Physics Simulation** is an interactive web application that visually demonstrates principles of physics, such as gravity and elastic collisions. Users can spawn colorful balls on a canvas that react dynamically according to real-world physics, creating an engaging learning experience.

## Live Demo
You can view the live demo of the project at: https://ball-physics-deepanshu.vercel.app/

## Features
- **Interactive Ball Creation:** Click anywhere on the canvas to spawn balls.
- **Gravity and Bounce Physics:** Balls fall and bounce with realistic physics simulations.
- **Colorful Ball Generation:** Each ball is assigned a random color upon spawning.
- **Dynamic Collisions:** Balls collide and interact in a lifelike manner.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 Canvas:** For rendering the simulation.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing physics and interactivity.
- **CSS:** For styling (if applicable).

## Installation

To run the Ball Physics Simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prog-deepanshu/ball-physics.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ball-physics-simulation
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**

## Usage
- Click on the canvas to create a new ball.
- Watch the balls as they fall, bounce, and collide with one another.

## Code Structure
- **index.html:** The main HTML file that sets up the canvas and includes scripts.
- **style.css:** (Optional) Contains styles for the application.
- **script.js:** Contains all the JavaScript logic for the simulation.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve collision detection efficiency using spatial partitioning.
- Add sound effects for collisions and interactions.
- Introduce variable properties for different ball types.
- Allow users to customize parameters like gravity and friction.
